# GotaHUB
An open-source project that creates a link between hotels and community gardens in the city of Barcelona to provide water for irrigation.
Using the **GotaKit** hotel guests can learn about Catalunia's drought and save shower water.
In the repository, you can find all the files to print your kit and start saving some water!
